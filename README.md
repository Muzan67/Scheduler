# Scheduler Generator

Please find a calender application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app dynaically feature updated HTML using JQuery and CSS.


The starter code uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time. but you're free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality because Moment.js is considered a "legacy" product. Learn more about these other solutions in the Moment.js project status page..

# Intsallation

The current display of the date and time has been achieved. The timeblocks are represented and change color depending of the time of day.
We can also save what we type in the hour of the daily planner.
