# Scheduler Generator

Please find a calender application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app dynaically feature updated HTML using JQuery and CSS.


The starter code uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time, but you're free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality because Moment.js is considered a "legacy" product. Learn more about these other solutions in the Moment.js project status page..

# Intsallation
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
